# Trying Once More But Still Not Impressed

Is it just me or do all the "artificial intelligence" designs on this actually look just like thegrid.io landing page? 

I'm wondering how it could even be possible for a system to infer my intent based on the content I create. This would necessitate a degree of intelligence that is well beyond the ability of most computers, including DeepThink, which recently celebrated triumphing over the world's greatest Go player. 

That said, even DeepThink has trouble learning the simplest video games and has show no indication that it is able to infer human emotion, the latter of which is absolutely required when creating a well-designed website. 

Again, I see this as evidence that thegrid.io is going to be little more than a design exercise for its creators.

Maybe I'm being unduly harsh, and that's not my intention. If nothing else, I applaud the effort by thegrid.io team. This is still a really cool interface.

I guess the big question becomes what the system is going to do with sites that have hundred or thousands of "posts" that are really multiple content types. How is it going to create menus, for example?
