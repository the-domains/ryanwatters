# Here is My First Heading

Here is some paragraph text. I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be writing. Is this really "artificial intelligence" or just a rather unimpressive layer on top of a Wordpress sensibility?

What do I mean by  a "Wordpress sensibility?" I mean that the idea of a piece of content being defined by a "post" is limiting. As someone who deals with content professionally, I wonder if this project is going in the wrong direction. At this clip, thegrid.io is poised to become the a very, very smart...blogging platform. I'm completely underwhelmed.
